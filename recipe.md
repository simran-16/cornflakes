take milk
pour it in a bowl
take cornflakes and them to the bowl too
Cut banana in small pieces 
add them to the boel
cornflakes are ready
 

 additional
 if you like you may even add dry fruits like almond etc or any other fruit you like

 but t=my best advise is to add banana as they really are a good combination with milk and cornflakes
